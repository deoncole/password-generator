# Password Generator

## Password generator can allow the users to select how long their password should be, between 8-128 characters. If the user doesn't choose between the two an alert is provided telling the user what values are accepted. The user can choose between special characters, upper and/or lowercase letters, and numbers. Once the choices are made, the new password is displayed on the screen.
